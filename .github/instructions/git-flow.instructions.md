## 5. Verification
- Encourage Copilot to remind developers to verify changes locally.
- Ensure that code generated by Copilot conforms to the repository's coding standards.

## 6. Code Quality and Formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks to automatically format code before commits.
  - Run `pre-commit install` to set up hooks for the repository.
  - Pre-commit will automatically format Dart code using `dart format`.
- **Manual formatting**: Always run `dart format .` before committing changes.
- **Formatting verification**: Use `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` to check if files need formatting.
- **CI/CD requirements**: All code must pass formatting checks in CI pipeline before merging.
- **Best practice**: Format code immediately after making changes to avoid accumulating formatting issues.
