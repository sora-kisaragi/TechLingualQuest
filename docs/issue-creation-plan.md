## Implementation Notes

1. **Start Date Calculation**: Replace `[Start Date + X days]` with actual dates based on project start date
2. **Assignee Assignment**: Assign issues to appropriate team members as they become available
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Use GitHub's task lists and issue references to track dependencies
4. **Progress Tracking**: Update issue progress regularly using checkboxes
5. **Milestone Deadlines**: Adjust milestone dates based on team capacity and other project constraints

This implementation plan provides a concrete structure for fulfilling Issue #10's requirement to create tasks with deadlines based on project documentation and roadmap.
